				This is the Data Visualization chart which Tracks National Unemployment, Job Gains and Job Losses across 20 different sectors each month from 2008 up until March 2017. This chart is 1 of the 4 charts of the original Data Visualization which can be accessed using the link above. The Data shows the percentage change from the previous month based on the sector's payrolls. The different sectors that the chart covers over the months are as follows:

				This visualization targets the recession that happened in 2008 and tracks the employments across the different sectors mentioned above and tracks how each individual sector has done over the decade. This helps in giving insights into what sector has done really well post recession as well as which sectors are still lagging behind and need special attention. What I really like about this visualization and why I chose this is because even though a large amount of data and categories are being used they visualize it in such a simple way which helps in understanding the data and also help gain insights from it. Just looking at the raw data it is impossible to even understand what the data is about and where each sector stands in terms of employment. This visualizatoin uses different widgets and colors to its advantage representing a dot as a sector in each column which represents a month of the year.The color usage is also very efficient as it shows us which sector has had a positive/negative growth from the previous month.It is a little interactive as well, when the user hovers over any particular sector of any month the dot is highlighted in black over all the months of the year. The construction sector is hovered over in the image as a result all the dots which represent the construction sector are highlighted in black.

                Such a feature will be really helpful in finding insights such as comparing how a particular sector has done over the years by just looking at the highlighted black dots on the chart. For instance in the image, the construction sector shows that it had a negative growth in 2008-2010 but slowly started a positive growth from there on till 2015 after which it showed small fluctuations again. Another example is the professional and business services sector which showed a small decline during recession but has had a steady growth since then.

                The other charts in the original Data Visualization show more details about the unemployment but go into more details breaking it down further more targetting specific categories like Gender, Age groups, ethnicity and education of individuals as well. The interesting fact is that all the charts are connected so they update and allow the flexibility to look at different categories to look for different insights or information based on the categories chosen. The second chart also shows the detailed data of the last month which is March 2017 which will be really helpful in determining the latest change in each sector. This detailed information helps with the user tasks like identifying the root problem of which sector needs more attention or which group has been affected the most since the recession. It also helps compare how each sector has been doing over the months the whole decade which is valuable information laid out as a foundation to know what can be done next to improve the employability situation in each of the sectors. These are my findings on what user tasks the visualization supports and is very insightful in laying out the foundation of the next and upcoming tasks.
